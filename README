Getting started:

Commands:

make
chmod 775 hmake.sh

That's all. You can use hmake.sh like that:

./hmake.sh [header_path]

It will search all functions in all c files in current directory and all it's sub-directories. If header isn't created yet, it will create basic one.
Hmake (header generator) will never remove a existing header file, it will just add at the end all found functions.

Share it if you found it usefull.
