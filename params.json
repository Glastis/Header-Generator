I have a solution for you !\r\n\r\n\r\n## Presentation\r\n\r\nHeader generator is a tool that adds at the end of .h passed in argument all prototypes of functions found (except static ones) in .c files in your pwd and in all it's sub-directories. Linker is no longer a slut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n- This tool works fine on linux and should works on cygwin. Must create windows version.\r\n\r\n- Graphical version.\r\n\r\n- Actualisation of functions instead of adding at the end. That will be a great feature.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion ?\r\n\r\nIf you have any idea, issue on my github.",
